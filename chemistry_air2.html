    "options": ["Ozone", "Oxygen", "Argon", "Carbon dioxide"],
    "answer": "Carbon dioxide",
    "explanation": "Excessive burning of fuels increases carbon dioxide concentration, which traps more heat in the atmosphere and leads to global warming.",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Why do earthworms often come out of the soil during heavy rains?",
    "options": ["They enjoy the cool temperature", "Rainwater fills the air spaces in the soil, forcing them out to respire", "They need to find water to drink", "They are looking for food on the surface"],
    "answer": "Rainwater fills the air spaces in the soil, forcing them out to respire",
    "explanation": "Soil contains air in its pores for organisms to breathe; when heavy rain fills these spaces, animals like earthworms must surface to find air.",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which instrument is used to indicate the direction of the wind at a specific place?",
    "options": ["Speedometer", "Weather cock", "Thermometer", "Odometer"],
    "answer": "Weather cock",
    "explanation": "A weather cock, or wind vane, is designed to show the direction from which the wind is blowing.",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  },
  {
    "text": "Air is a mixture of several gases. Which two gases together make up approximately 99% of the atmosphere?",
    "options": ["Oxygen and Carbon dioxide", "Nitrogen and Argon", "Nitrogen and Oxygen", "Oxygen and Water vapour"],
    "answer": "Nitrogen and Oxygen",
    "explanation": "Nitrogen (~78%) and Oxygen (~21%) together constitute the vast majority of the air mixture.",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  },
  {
    "text": "How do plants and animals maintain the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?",
    "options": ["Through wind cycles", "Through respiration and photosynthesis", "By the melting of glaciers", "By absorbing nitrogen from the soil"],
    "answer": "Through respiration and photosynthesis",
    "explanation": "Respiration consumes oxygen and releases CO2, while photosynthesis consumes CO2 and releases oxygen, creating a continuous cycle of interdependence.",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "What is the scientific term for the thick layer of the atmosphere that often forms in winter when smoke mixes with fog?",
    "options": ["Mist", "Soot", "Smog", "Haze"],
    "answer": "Smog",

    "options": ["Nitrogen", "Oxygen", "Carbon dioxide", "Helium"],
    "answer": "Oxygen",
    "explanation": "Oxygen is necessary for the process of respiration, where it reacts with food to produce the energy required by living beings.",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which of the following is an abiotic component of the environment?",
    "options": ["Plants", "Bacteria", "Air", "Fungi"],

    "text": "Which gas is used in electric bulbs to prevent the filament from burning out?",
    "options": ["Oxygen", "Carbon dioxide", "Argon", "Hydrogen"],
    "answer": "Argon",
    "explanation": "Argon, an inert gas, is used in bulbs because it does not react with the filament even at high temperatures.",
    "difficulty": "medium"

    "explanation": "Bubbles prove that air was inside the bottle occupying space and could only be replaced by water once it was given a path to escape.",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  },
  {
    "text": "What is the approximate concentration of carbon dioxide in a clean, unpolluted atmosphere?",
    "options": ["21%", "0.9%", "0.03% to 0.04%", "4%"],

    "explanation": "Carbon dioxide makes up a very small but essential fraction of the atmosphere, typically between 0.03% and 0.04%.",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which of the following describes the relationship between oxygen in atmospheric air and air dissolved in water?",
