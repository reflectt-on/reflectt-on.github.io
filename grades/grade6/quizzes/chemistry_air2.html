    "options": ["It increases", "It stays the same", "It decreases", "It fluctuates randomly"],
    "answer": "It decreases",
    "explanation": "Atmospheric pressure, which is the weight of the air above, decreases the higher you go in elevation [7, 9].",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which part of a plant leaf allows for the exchange of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen with the atmosphere?",
    "options": ["Petiole", "Chlorophyll", "Stomata", "Lamina"],
    "answer": "Stomata",
    "explanation": "Stomata are tiny pores on the leaf surface that facilitate the absorption of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen [6, 9].",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which gas is produced as a byproduct when green plants manufacture their food through photosynthesis?",
    "options": ["Carbon dioxide", "Nitrogen", "Oxygen", "Argon"],

    "text": "The increase in the concentration of which gas is primarily responsible for global warming?",
    "options": ["Oxygen", "Nitrogen", "Carbon dioxide", "Ozone"],
    "answer": "Carbon dioxide",
    "explanation": "Human activities like burning fuels have increased carbon dioxide levels, which traps more heat and leads to a rise in the Earth's average temperature [18, 19].",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "What can be observed to prove that air contains dissolved gases even when it is in a liquid state like water?",
    "options": ["Water changing to ice", "Tiny bubbles appearing on the inner surface when water is heated", "Water turning blue", "The water level rising"],
    "answer": "Tiny bubbles appearing on the inner surface when water is heated",
