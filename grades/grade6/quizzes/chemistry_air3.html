    const questionsData = [
         {
    "text": "If we consider the 1% of the atmosphere that is NOT comprised of Nitrogen or Oxygen, which gas is the most abundant within that specific fraction?",
    "options": ["Carbon dioxide", "Argon", "Water vapour", "Helium"],
    "answer": "Argon",
    "explanation": "While Nitrogen and Oxygen make up 99% of the air, the remaining 1% is mostly composed of Argon (0.9%), with Carbon dioxide and other trace gases making up the rest [1, 2].",
    "difficulty": "hard"
  },
  {
    "text": "What occurs to the boiling point of water at the top of a high mountain compared to sea level, and why?",
    "options": ["It increases because atmospheric pressure is higher", "It decreases because atmospheric pressure is lower", "It stays the same because temperature is lower", "It decreases because oxygen is less abundant"],
    "answer": "It decreases because atmospheric pressure is lower",
    "explanation": "According to the sources, atmospheric pressure decreases as you go higher in elevation; this lower pressure causes the boiling point of water to reduce [3-5].",
    "difficulty": "hard"
  },
  {
    "text": "Based on the solubility of gases in water, how does the percentage of oxygen in dissolved air compare to its percentage in the atmosphere?",
    "explanation": "The sources state that because oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen, the air dissolved in water contains a higher percentage of oxygen (30–35%) than ordinary atmospheric air (21%) [6].",
    "options": ["It is lower (approx 15%)", "It is exactly the same (21%)", "It is higher (approx 30-35%)", "Dissolved air contains no oxygen"],
    "answer": "It is higher (approx 30-35%)",

    "difficulty": "hard"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which of the following describes the percentage of Oxygen present in the Earth’s crust by weight, as opposed to its volume in the atmosphere?",
    "options": ["21%", "78%", "49.85%", "0.03%"],

    "difficulty": "hard"
  },
  {
    "text": "If a sample of air contains 4% water vapour, what can be inferred about the remaining composition of that specific sample?",
    "options": ["Oxygen must increase to 25%", "The combined percentage of other gases must decrease to 96%", "Carbon dioxide will disappear", "Nitrogen becomes the only other component"],
    "answer": "The combined percentage of other gases must decrease to 96%",
    "explanation": "Air is a mixture; if water vapour constitutes approximately 4% of the volume in lower layers, the other components must adjust to make up the total 100% [1].",
    "difficulty": "hard"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which layer of the atmosphere contains the highest concentration of air, with 99% of total air found within just 30 km of the surface?",
    "options": ["Troposphere and lower Stratosphere", "Exosphere", "Mesosphere", "Thermosphere"],
    "answer": "Troposphere and lower Stratosphere",
    "explanation": "The sources note that compared to Earth's size, the atmosphere is thin; 99% of all air is found up to a height of 30 kilometres above the surface [1].",
    "difficulty": "medium"

  {
    "text": "In the context of combustion, what is the critical role played by Nitrogen in the atmosphere?",
    "options": ["It acts as a fuel for the fire", "It acts as a neutral diluent to control the rate of burning", "It combines with oxygen to create water vapour", "It is the only gas that allows matchsticks to light"],
    "answer": "It acts as a neutral diluent to control the rate of burning",
    "explanation": "Nitrogen is chemically neutral; its presence prevents substances from burning uncontrollably by diluting the oxygen [10].",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Why do mountaineers experience more fatigue at high altitudes according to the physics of the atmosphere?",
    "options": ["Because gravity is stronger at high peaks", "Because atmospheric pressure is lower and oxygen is less abundant", "Because the wind speed is too high for respiration", "Because carbon dioxide levels rise at high altitudes"],
    "answer": "Because atmospheric pressure is lower and oxygen is less abundant",
    "explanation": "At high elevations, atmospheric pressure decreases and the air gets rarer, meaning oxygen is less abundant, leading to fatigue and breathing difficulties [3, 11].",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which gas is used in electric bulbs specifically because it is an 'inert gas' and does not react with the filament?",
    "options": ["Nitrogen", "Oxygen", "Argon", "Carbon dioxide"],

    "text": "Which of the following is considered an 'abiotic' component of the environment that is essential for weather formation?",
    "options": ["Plants", "Bacteria", "Atmosphere", "Fungi"],
    "answer": "Atmosphere",
    "explanation": "The environment consists of biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components. The atmosphere is an abiotic component where weather formation occurs [15, 16].",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  },
  {
    "text": "Ozone is extremely useful for living beings because it acts as a protective layer against which of the following?",
    "options": ["Infrared radiation", "X-rays", "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation", "Microwaves"],

    "explanation": "Ozone in the atmosphere prevents harmful ultraviolet rays from reaching the Earth, protecting living organisms [1, 17].",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  },
  {
    "text": "When water is heated, bubbles appear on the inner surface of the vessel before boiling begins. This observation proves that:",
    "options": ["Water is a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen", "Air is dissolved in water", "The container is leaking air", "The heat is creating new air"],
    "answer": "Air is dissolved in water",
    "explanation": "Heating water causes the air dissolved within it to escape, which is seen as tiny air bubbles on the inner surface [18].",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  {
    "text": "In the process of photosynthesis, plants use carbon dioxide and release which gas back into the atmosphere?",
    "options": ["Nitrogen", "Argon", "Oxygen", "Helium"],
    "answer": "Oxygen",
    "explanation": "Plants take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and produce oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for animal respiration [1, 19].",
    "difficulty": "easy"
